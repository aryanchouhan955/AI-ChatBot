# AI Chatbot Web Application

## Project Description

This project is a **modern AI-powered chatbot web application** built using **React** and integrated with the **Gemini API**.  
It provides an interactive chat experience similar to ChatGPT, featuring real-time responses, conversation history, and a clean dark-themed user interface.

The application is designed with a **modular architecture**, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and stability while avoiding common React issues such as message disappearance and incorrect re-renders.

## How the Application Works

1. User sends a message through the input field  
2. The message is added to the active conversation with a unique ID  
3. An AI placeholder message is created  
4. The Gemini API generates a response  
5. The response is displayed using a typewriter effect  
6. The conversation history is updated in the sidebar  

Each message is tracked using **stable unique identifiers**, preventing React from reusing incorrect DOM elements.
